combines next generation non volatile 3d cross memory with intel advance system memory controller and 
interface hw and sw enhancements


3d cross memory dense--> pack lots of capacity into  atiny footprint, 
slicing some microscopic layers into columns each memory cell and selector 
connect with cropsspoint structure perpendicular wires, enables memory cell to be individually addressed
by selecting 1 wire on top and another on the bottom.
We can stack this 3dimensionally to maximize density

DRAM needs a transitor on each memory cell to access or modify the cell, making DRAM big and expensive
INTEL OPTANE CAN BE WRITTEN O READ BY SIMPLY VARYING THE VOLTAGE SENT TO ITS SELECTOR
ELIMINATING THE NEED OF TRANSISTORS

SIMPLE, STACKABLE, TRANSISTOR LESS DESIGN
GREATER CAPACITY IN THE SAME SPACE
LOW LATENCY IS SHORTER THAN DRAM 
IDEAL FOR ALL DEVICES APPS OR SERVICES REQUIRING FAST ACCESS TO LARGE SETS OF DATA

UNPARALLEL COMBINATION OF SPEED, DENSITY AND NON VOLATILITY

DESIGNERS GAMERS, FILMMAKERS
accelerates computers responsiveness
access frecuently docs photos videos and apps quickly
